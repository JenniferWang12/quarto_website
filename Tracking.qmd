Today in 551, we learned just about everything related to continuous random variables. It's time to do integrals again. It's been four years, what are integrals? Abba abba!

This morning, I don't know why the main road leading to the bus station was blocked. Even though I left on time, I had to take a detour through the housing area, which resulted in me arriving at the station late. I missed three consecutive buses â€“ it was frustrating! The next bus was packed, and one person even cut in line...  

Today, I learned about numpy in Python, and I'm not very familiar with np.array, which is bothering me.  

I had a statistics quiz today 551. There was a question that seemed to suggest using the geometric distribution, but I felt the question was not clear in its meaning, so I didn't answer it that way. The result might be I answered it incorrectly:(
